For the first three articles we inserted the article id, the article title and its text into the table.

Using this sql query:
cursor.execute("INSERT into articles VALUES(%s,%s,%s)", (splitted[0], splitted[2], text))

The measured time with timeit was: 168.56 seconds



In the second program a csv is written which contains a row with article id, word and word count for each word in each article.

Using this sql query:
cursor.execute("SELECT id, word[1], count(*) FROM (SELECT regexp_matches(lower(a.text), '[A-Za-z\-]*', 'g') AS word, a.id FROM articles as a) AS view GROUP BY word, id ORDER BY word ASC")

The measured time with timeit was: 19 seconds
