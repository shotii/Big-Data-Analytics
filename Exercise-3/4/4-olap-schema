The main measurement that is done for the logs on Wikipedia websites is the time a user spent on the website. These are even very relevant information that a business would want to analyze with respect to different aspects. For example, the business might be interested in the average time spent for different countries or browser user agents. This might give indication about the quality of the website in different countries or across different browser user agents. 

So, for us, most part of the big data analytics process is done considering the time a user spent on the website. Since this is the main factum which businesses or other institutions are very interested in, our data warehouse should be modelled with that in mind, i.e. time spent on the website is the factum in the fact table/cube, while all other should be modelled as dimensions of the cube.
